### Fallback to host DNS
If enabled, will fallback to host dns for resolving domains. This is useful if using istio or dapr in the host cluster and sidecar containers cannot connect to the central instance. Its also useful if you want to access host cluster services from within the vcluster. We can enable this feature with
```yaml
fallbackHostDns: true
```

## Ingress Controller Traffic
The vcluster has the option to enable Ingress resources synchronization. That means that you can create an ingress in a vcluster to make a service in this vcluster available via a hostname/domain. However, instead of having to run a separate ingress controller in each vcluster, the ingress resource will be synchronized to the underlying cluster (when enabled) which means that the vcluster can use a shared ingress controller that is running in the host cluster. This helps to share resources across different vclusters and is easier for users of vclusters because otherwise, they would need to install an ingress controller and manually configure DNS for each vcluster.

:::info 
Before the v0.12.0 release of vcluster, the Ingress synchronization was enabled by default.
:::


### Enable Ingress Sync
If you want to use an ingress controller from the underlying cluster by synchronizing the Ingress resources, set the following in your `values.yaml`: 
```
sync:
  ingresses:
    enabled: true
```
then create or upgrade the vcluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster --upgrade -f values.yaml
```

By default, when Ingress sync is enabled, the IngressClasses will be synced from the underlying cluster to the vcluster. This can be disabled by setting the following in your `values.yaml`: 
```
sync:
  ingressclasses:
    enabled: false
```

### SSL Certificates
Because the syncer keeps typical SSL provisioning related annotations for ingresses, you may also set the cert-manager ingress annotations on an ingress in your vclusters to use the cert-manager of the underlying host cluster to automatically provision SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.

## Network Policies
Kubernetes has a [Network Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) resource type that allows creation of the rules that govern how pods communicate with each other.

By default, vcluster ignores these resources. However, once you enable synchronization of the Network Policies, vcluster will ensure correct policies are created in the host cluster to achieve the desired traffic behaviour.

:::info 
Network Policies in vcluster rely on the support for this feature in the host cluster. Make sure that your host cluster satisfies the [Network Policy prerequisites](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#prerequisites).
:::

### Enable Network Policy Sync
To enable the synchronization of the Network Policy resources add the following to your `values.yaml`:
```
sync:
  networkpolicies:
    enabled: true
```
then create or upgrade the vcluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster --upgrade -f values.yaml
```
