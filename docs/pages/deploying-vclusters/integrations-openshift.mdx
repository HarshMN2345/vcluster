By default, OpenShift doesn't allow running containers with the root user, but it assigns a random UID from the allowed range automatically, which means that you can skip the steps described in the [Running as non-root user](#running-as-non-root-user) section of this document and your vcluster should run as non-root user by default.

OpenShift also imposes some restrictions that are not common to other Kubernetes distributions.  
When deploying vcluster to OpenShift you will need to follow these additional steps:

<OpenshiftSegment/>

:::info Additional permission when running on OpenShift
vcluster requires `create` permission for the `endpoints/restricted` resource in the default group when running on OpenShift.  
This permission is required because OpenShift has additional built-in admission controller for the Endpoint resources, which denies creation of the endpoints pointing into the cluster network or service network CIDR ranges, unless this additional permission is given.
Following the steps outline above ensures that the vcluster Role includes this permission, as it is necessary for certain networking features.
